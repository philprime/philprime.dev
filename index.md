### Hi, Iâ€™m Phil â€“ welcome to my personal website!

Iâ€™m an open-source advocate, software engineer, and technical startup founder. Iâ€™ve been deeply involved in software
development since 2013, and over the years, Iâ€™ve built everything from open-source libraries to large-scale automation
platforms.

**Software isnâ€™t just my work â€” itâ€™s something I genuinely love doing.**

My main driver is to build products that either solve problems or to innovate and fascinate with unexpected
possibilities.

I work as a senior software engineer at [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io), where I focus on enabling developers to ship
products with confidence. I am also an alumni of the Startup Incubation Program at the
[TU Wien Innovation Incubation Center](https://i2c.tuwien.ac.at).

### My Companies

These are the companies Iâ€™ve co-founded (so far ðŸ˜‰):

- **[kula.app](https://kula.app)** â€“ A startup dedicated to making mobile app development accessible to everyone,
  without requiring code.
- **[techprimate](https://techprimate.com)** â€“ A mobile app development agency in Austria, working on client projects
  and independent apps.

### Projects Iâ€™m Involved In

Open-source is a big part of my work, and Iâ€™ve been fortunate to contribute to and maintain several projects:

- **[TPPDF](https://github.com/techprimate/TPPDF)** â€“ A Swift framework for generating PDFs.
- **[Postie](https://github.com/kula-app/Postie)** â€“ A structured HTTP client for Swift, making network requests more
  manageable.
- **[OnLaunch](https://github.com/kula-app/OnLaunch)** â€“ A lightweight framework for handling app launch configurations.
- **[App Store Metadata API](https://app-store-metadata-api.kula.app)** â€“ A real-time API for fetching iOS app metadata.
