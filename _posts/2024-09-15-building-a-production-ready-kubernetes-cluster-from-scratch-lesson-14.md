In this lesson, we will test and verify the high-availability configuration of
your Kubernetes control plane. Ensuring that your control plane is resilient to
node failures is critical for maintaining cluster stability and continuous
operation. We will simulate node failures and observe the behavior of the
control plane to confirm that the redundancy and load balancing setup is
functioning correctly.

This is the sixteenth lesson in the series on building a production-ready
Kubernetes cluster from scratch. Make sure you have completed the
[previous lesson](/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch/lesson-14)
before continuing here. The full list of lessons in the series can be found
[in the overview](/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch).

## Verify connection and network speed between pods

To test the network speed between pods, you can use the `iperf3` tool. This tool
allows you to measure the network bandwidth between two pods in your cluster.

To deploy the `iperf3` server pod on every node at the same time, we can use a
Kubernetes `DaemonSet`. Connect to one of your nodes and create a file named
`iperf3-daemonset.yaml` with the following content (e.g. using `nano` or `vi`):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: iperf3
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: iperf3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: iperf3
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: iperf3
          image: networkstatic/iperf3
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5201
          command: ['iperf3']
          args: ['-s'] # Run in server mode
```

Apply the DaemonSet configuration to deploy the `iperf3` server pods:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f iperf3-daemonset.yaml
```

Get the list of pods to verify that the `iperf3` server pods are running:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -l app=iperf3 -o wide
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE                NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
iperf3-b7tp5   1/1     Running   0          5m45s   10.244.0.6   kubernetes-node-1   <none>           <none>
iperf3-g4k2b   1/1     Running   0          5m45s   10.244.2.4   kubernetes-node-3   <none>           <none>
iperf3-zztwd   1/1     Running   0          5m45s   10.244.1.5   kubernetes-node-2   <none>           <none>
```

Create an interactive shell session in one of the `iperf3` server pods to check
the network speed:

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it iperf3-b7tp5 -- /bin/bash
```

Run the following command to test the network speed to one of the other `iperf3`
server pods:

```bash
root@iperf3-pgt7j:/# iperf3 -c 10.244.2.9
Connecting to host 10.244.2.9, port 5201

```

Cleanup the `iperf3` server pods after you are done testing:

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f iperf3-daemonset.yaml
$ rm iperf3-daemonset.yaml
```

## Lesson Conclusion

Congratulations! After successfully testing and verifying the high-availability
setup of your control plane, your cluster is now resilient and capable of
maintaining operation even during node failures. In the next lesson, we will
implement redundancy with Keepalived or HAProxy to ensure continuous access to
the control plane even in case of node failures.

You have completed this lesson and you can now continue with
[the next section](/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch/section-15).
