In this section, you will learn how to initialize the Kubernetes control plane,
join additional nodes to the cluster, and install a pod network to enable
communication between nodes.

This is the fourth section in the series on building a production-ready
Kubernetes cluster from scratch. Make sure you have completed the
[previous section](#) before continuing here. The full list of lessons in the
series can be found
[in the overview](/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch).

## Lessons

- [L11: Initializing the First Control Plane Node](/2024/XX/XX/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch-l11)

  > Initialize the first control plane node in your Kubernetes cluster,
  > including running kubeadm init and configuring the control plane.

- [L12: Joining Additional Control Plane Nodes](/2024/XX/XX/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch-l12)

  > Learn how to join additional Raspberry Pi devices to the cluster to create a
  > high-availability control plane.

- [L13: Installing a Pod Network (CNI Plugin)](/2024/XX/XX/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch-l13)

  > Install and configure a CNI plugin (e.g., Calico or Flannel) to enable pod
  > communication across nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.
