In this lesson, we will learn how to conduct routine security audits and
vulnerability scans to maintain the security posture of your Kubernetes cluster.
Regular security audits are crucial for identifying potential risks, ensuring
compliance with security policies, and mitigating vulnerabilities that could be
exploited by attackers.

This is the thirty-first lesson in the series on building a production-ready
Kubernetes cluster from scratch. Make sure you have completed the
[previous lesson](/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch/lesson-30)
before continuing here. The full list of lessons in the series can be found
[in the overview](/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch).

## Importance of Regular Security Audits

Security audits help you:

- **Identify vulnerabilities** in your cluster, such as insecure configurations,
  outdated software, and exposed secrets.
- **Ensure compliance** with security policies and industry standards.
- **Mitigate risks** by proactively detecting and addressing potential security
  threats before they are exploited.

## Step 1: Install and Use Kubernetes Security Tools

Several open-source tools can help you audit your Kubernetes cluster for
security vulnerabilities:

1. **Kube-Bench**: A tool that checks whether your Kubernetes cluster is
   configured according to the security best practices defined in the CIS
   (Center for Internet Security) Kubernetes Benchmark.

   - **Install Kube-Bench:**

     Run the following command to install Kube-Bench on a control plane node:

     ```bash
     wget https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench/releases/download/v0.6.9/kube-bench_0.6.9_linux_amd64.tar.gz
     tar -xvf kube-bench_0.6.9_linux_amd64.tar.gz
     sudo mv kube-bench /usr/local/bin/
     ```

   - **Run Kube-Bench:**

     Run Kube-Bench to scan your cluster against the CIS Benchmark:

     ```bash
     kube-bench
     ```

     Review the output and address any issues that are flagged as "FAIL" or
     "WARN."

2. **Kubescape**: A tool that provides a comprehensive scan for
   misconfigurations, compliance checks, and vulnerabilities in Kubernetes
   clusters and workloads.

   - **Install Kubescape:**

     Run the following command to install Kubescape:

     ```bash
     curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armosec/kubescape/master/install.sh | /bin/bash
     ```

   - **Run Kubescape:**

     Scan your cluster for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations:

     ```bash
     kubescape scan framework nsa --exclude-namespaces kube-system,kube-public,kube-node-lease
     ```

     The output will provide a report with a list of compliance checks and their
     results. Address any failures as necessary.

3. **Trivy**: A vulnerability scanner for container images, Kubernetes
   manifests, and cluster components.

   - **Install Trivy:**

     Install Trivy using the following command:

     ```bash
     sudo apt install trivy
     ```

   - **Run Trivy:**

     Use Trivy to scan your cluster for vulnerabilities:

     ```bash
     trivy k8s --report summary cluster
     ```

     Review the findings and update or patch any vulnerable components.

## Step 2: Conduct Regular Kubernetes Configuration Audits

1. **Audit Kubernetes API Server Logs:**

   Check the API server logs regularly for unusual or unauthorized activity:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n kube-system <kube-apiserver-pod-name>
   ```

   Look for any suspicious API calls, failed authentication attempts, or other
   abnormal behavior.

2. **Review Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Policies:**

   Regularly review and audit RBAC policies to ensure that users, groups, and
   service accounts have the minimum necessary permissions.

   - List all roles and bindings:

     ```bash
     kubectl get roles --all-namespaces
     kubectl get rolebindings --all-namespaces
     ```

   - Review each role and binding to ensure they follow the principle of least
     privilege.

3. **Check Network Policies:**

   Verify that your network policies are correctly implemented to restrict
   traffic between pods and namespaces:

   ```bash
   kubectl get networkpolicy --all-namespaces
   ```

   Test connectivity to ensure policies are effective in preventing unauthorized
   access.

4. **Monitor for Security Events:**

   Use your centralized logging setup (EFK stack) to monitor for security
   events, such as:

   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Suspicious API requests
   - Changes to critical resources

## Step 3: Perform Vulnerability Scanning

1. **Scan Container Images:**

   Ensure that all container images used in your cluster are free of known
   vulnerabilities:

   - Use a tool like Trivy or Clair to scan container images before deploying
     them:

     ```bash
     trivy image <image-name>
     ```

   - Address any vulnerabilities found by updating images or applying patches.

2. **Check Node Security:**

   Regularly audit the security of your cluster nodes:

   - Ensure that nodes are running the latest security patches for the operating
     system and Kubernetes components.
   - Verify that nodes are configured securely (e.g., no unauthorized ports
     open, minimal access, etc.).

## Step 4: Establish a Routine Audit Schedule

1. **Define a Regular Audit Schedule:**

   Establish a regular schedule for performing security audits and scans:

   - Weekly or bi-weekly checks for critical components and vulnerabilities.
   - Monthly or quarterly reviews of cluster configurations, RBAC policies, and
     network policies.

2. **Automate Audits and Alerts:**

   Where possible, automate security checks and alerts using CI/CD pipelines,
   monitoring tools, and security scanning tools. For example:

   - Integrate Trivy scans into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure only secure images
     are deployed.
   - Set up alerts in Grafana or other monitoring tools for suspicious activity.

## Step 5: Respond to Security Incidents

1. **Develop an Incident Response Plan:**

   Have a predefined incident response plan in place that includes:

   - Steps to isolate and mitigate the incident (e.g., revoking access, shutting
     down affected pods).
   - Communication protocols to inform stakeholders.
   - Documentation procedures for capturing details about the incident.

2. **Conduct Post-Incident Reviews:**

   After any security incident, conduct a post-incident review to understand
   what went wrong and how to prevent similar incidents in the future. Update
   security policies and configurations accordingly.

## Lesson Conclusion

Congratulations! By performing regular security audits and vulnerability scans,
you ensure that your Kubernetes cluster remains secure and compliant with best
practices. In the next section, we will conclude the course by reviewing key
concepts, providing additional resources for further learning, and gathering
feedback for future improvements.
