---

Welcome to my new series on building a production-ready Kubernetes cluster from
scratch using Raspberry Pi devices. In this series, you can follow along to
build your own dedicated Kubernetes cluster at home, from hardware assembly to
cluster setup and management. The learnings can then be applied to real-world
scenarios, and scaled up to larger clusters as needed.

In particular, this series will cover the following topics:

- Set up a high-availability Kubernetes cluster using Raspberry Pi devices, from
  hardware assembly to network configuration
- Install, configure, and manage Kubernetes control plane nodes for redundancy
  and fault tolerance
- Deploy persistent storage and learn to manage container images and data
  effectively across multiple nodes.
- Implement security best practices, monitoring, and logging to maintain a
  resilient and secure Kubernetes cluster.

This series is perfect for you, if you are any one of the following:

- Tech enthusiasts, developers, and IT professionals who want to prototype
  cluster using Raspberry Pi devices.
- Beginner to intermediate learners with basic Linux and networking knowledge
  who want to deepen their understanding of Kubernetes.
- DIY hobbyists and makers interested in hands-on projects and building home
  labs or edge computing solutions with affordable hardware.
- DevOps engineers and system administrators looking to explore Kubernetes
  clustering, high availability, and storage management in resource-constrained
  environments.
- Educators and students in computer science or IT fields seeking practical
  experience with Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies.

To follow along you will need to meet these requirements:

- Basic understanding of Linux command line and shell scripting (e.g.,
  navigating directories, editing files, running commands).
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts (pods, services, deployments) is
  helpful but not required.
- Familiarity with networking concepts, including IP addresses, subnets, DNS,
  and SSH.
- A computer running a unix-like system, such as Linux/macOS or Windows
  Subsystem with Linux (WSL), with an ethernet port for connecting to network.
- SSH client (e.g., OpenSSH, PuTTY) for remote access to Raspberry Pi devices.
- At least 3 Raspberry Pi devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM) with
  MicroSD card (32GB or higher, high endurance recommended), USB-C power
  supplies for each
- A gigabit Ethernet router and switch (e.g., ER605) and Ethernet cables (CAT5e
  or higher).
- NVMe HATs for each Raspberry Pi with an SSD (512GB or higher)
