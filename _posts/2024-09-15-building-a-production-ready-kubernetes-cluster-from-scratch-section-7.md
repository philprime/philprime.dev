In this section, you will learn how to apply role-based access control (RBAC),
enable mutual TLS authentication,and implement network policies to secure the
Kubernetes cluster.

This is the seventh section in the series on building a production-ready
Kubernetes cluster from scratch. Make sure you have completed the
[previous section](#) before continuing here. The full list of lessons in the
series can be found
