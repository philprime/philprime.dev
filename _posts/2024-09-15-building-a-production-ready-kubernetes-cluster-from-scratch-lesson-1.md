Welcome to the first lesson of our series on building a production-ready
Kubernetes cluster from scratch using Raspberry Pi devices! In this lesson,
we'll provide an overview of the course, its structure, and what you can expect
to learn. You'll see how this course will guide you through the process of
setting up a high-availability Kubernetes cluster at home, and how the skills
you gain can be applied to real-world scenarios, from personal projects to
professional environments.

This is the first lesson in the series on building a production-ready Kubernetes
cluster from scratch. The full list of lessons in the series can be found
[in the overview](/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch).
