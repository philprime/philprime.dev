A good developer should write great code with high maintainability and extensibility. Even better developers extend the
programming language with smart functionality that makes it easier to read and write clean code.

Let me show you 5 code extensions for Swift, which I use on a daily basis. Every single one is explained in detail and
recreated from its backstory/original intent.

In case you TL;DR and only want to see the code, scroll to each **The Smart Solutions** headline for the copy-paste
ready code, or checkout the link in the conclusion.

## 1. Safe Array access with custom subscripts

Every developer has at least once experienced an _“out-of-bounds”_ exception. These occur when you try to access an
element at a position which is either negative or higher than the element count.

```swift
let values = ["A", "B", "C"]
values[0] // A
values[1] // B
values[2] // C
values[3] // Fatal error: Index out of range
```

We start to create bound checks before accessing the value. That leads to repetitive code even tough it always does the
exact same thing: checking the index bounds.

```swift
if 2 < values.count {
    values[2] // "C"
}
if 3 < values.count {
    values[3] // won't be called
}
```

Let’s create a function to wrap the bounds check, taking the element index and the array of elements as parameters. To
support any kind of element, we add a generic type `T`. This function returns an `Optional` value wrapping either the
element or `nil` if the index is out of bounds.

```swift
func getValue<T>(in elements: [T], at index: Int) -> T? {
    guard index >= 0 && index < elements.count else {
        return nil
    }
    return elements[index]
}

let values = ["A", "B", "C"]
getValue(in: values, at: 2) // "C"
getValue(in: values, at: 3) // nil
```

This works fine, but it is still quite verbose and (simply said) ugly compared to the original e.g. `values[2]`.
Especially because of the additional parameter values .

First off we want to get rid of values parameter and instead associate the function getValue with the array. As Swift
supports extending classes and protocols, we can move our getValue into an extension of Array:

```swift
extension Array {

    func getValue(at index: Int) -> Element? {
        guard index >= 0 && index < self.count else {
            return nil
        }
        return self[index]
    }
}

let values = ["A", "B", "C"]
values.getValue(at: 2) // "C"
values.getValue(at: 3) // nil
```

To use even more of the sweet Swift syntax capabilities, change the function to be a subscript function.

### The Smart Solution:

```swift
extension Array {

    subscript (safe index: Int) -> Element? {
        guard index >= 0 && index < self.count else {
            return nil
        }
        return self[index]
    }
}

values[safe: 2] // "C"
values[safe: 3] // nil
```

Awesome! Our access call `values[safe: 2]` looks almost identical to the original one `values[2]` but provides us
boundary safe access to the elements.

_EDIT 04.05.2021:_

Thanks to [Daniil Vorobyev](https://daniilspirit.medium.com/) for his response on Medium! Here a even more generic
example, which can be used for any class implementing the Collection protocol:

```swift
extension Collection {
    public subscript(safe index: Self.Index) -> Iterator.Element? {
        (startIndex ..< endIndex).contains(index) ? self[index] : nil
    }
}
```

## 2. Handling nil and empty Strings equally

When working with optional values, we often need to compare them with nil for null-checking. Sometimes we use a default
value, in case the value is in fact nil, to keep going.

Here an example method which returns a default value in case the parameter is `nil`:

```swift
func unwrap(value: String?) -> String {
    return value ?? "default value"
}
unwrap(value: "foo") // foo
unwrap(value: nil) // default value
```

But another edge exists too: empty Strings.

If we use this unwrap method with an empty string `""` it will return the same empty String. There are definitely
use-cases where we don’t want this behavior, but instead treat the empty String the same way as `nil` .

We have to extend our function with a length check:

```swift
func unwrap(value: String?) -> String {
    let defaultValue = "default value"
    guard let value = value else {
        return defaultValue
    }
    if value.isEmpty {
        return defaultValue
    }
    return value
}
unwrap(value: "foo") // foo
unwrap(value: "")    // default value
unwrap(value: nil)   // default value
```

Quite an ugly solution for such a simple fallback, right? So, how about compressing it into a single line of code?

```swift
func unwrapCompressed(value val: String?) -> String {
    return val != nil && !val!.isEmpty ? val! : "default value"
}
unwrapCompressed(value: "foo") // foo
unwrapCompressed(value: "") // default value
unwrapCompressed(value: nil) // default value
```

It works, but neither is this solution readable nor “good” by any standards, especially when trying to avoid
force-unwrapping `!` (to reduce the potential of unhandled crashes).

### The Smart Solution:

Convert empty strings to nil and work with the built-in support of `Optional`:

```swift
public extension String {
    var nilIfEmpty: String? {
        self.isEmpty ? nil : self
    }
}
```

Using this smart extension, you can use e.g. if-let unwrapping for checking for nil and for empty strings at the same
time:

```swift
var foo: String? = nil
if let value = foo?.nilIfEmpty {
    bar(value) // not called
}
if let value = "".nilIfEmpty {
    bar(value) // not called
}
if let value = "ABC".nilIfEmpty {
    bar(value) // called with "ABC"
}
```

Additionally this extension allows you to use a default value using `??` when the string is empty:

```swift
let foo = "ABC" ?? "123"  // ABC
let bar = "" ?? "456"      // 456
```

## 3. Multi Assignment Operator

On iOS, interfaces are built using `UIKit`’s `UIView`s, nested inside more UIViews, managed by a `UIWindow`, eventually
resulting in a view hierarchy (same for AppKit on macOS).

When developers interact with the UI, they most certainly need references to specific views, which are then stored
inside instance variables.

Let’s take a look at an example view controller.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {

    private weak var someViewRef: UIView?

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        let someView = UIView()
        self.someViewRef = someView
        self.view.addSubview(someView)
    }

    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillAppear(animated)

        // Update the background on appear
        someViewRef?.backgroundColor = .red
    }
}
```

First we create someView and add it to the view hierarchy in viewDidLoad. Afterwards we set a weak reference to the
someViewRef instance property so we can interact with the view in viewWillAppear :

Zooming in on the detail we want to improve:

```swift
(1) let someView = UIView()
(2) self.someViewRef = someView
(3) self.view.addSubview(someView)
```

We want to reduce these 3 lines of code, without compromising on readability. This might seem over-engineered for this
small single use case, but think about a view controller where 20 or even 30 views are created --> 20–30 lines of code
can be saved.

To really understand what is going on, you have to know about _Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)_.

### Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)

ARC was introduced in Objective-C as form of memory management back in iOS 5.

When creating the view in line (1), some memory (enough to hold an UIView) is allocated for the instance. In the same
step, an internal counter is set to 1, as someView is a reference to this instance. When assigning the `someViewRef` in
lin (2) the counter increases by one. The final line (3) increases it once again (to a total count of 3), because the
view hierarchy also holds a reference to the particular view.

At the end of `viewDidLoad` method, all local variables and references are discarded, including someView. This
decrements the counter, and it is left at 2 for `someViewRef` and the view hierarchy (because of view.addSubview(...))

> One of the core principles of UIKit/AppKit is letting the view hierarchy be the only one holding the strong references
> to the views.

So in case the view gets removed from the overall view hierarchy, the counter should be decremented to 0 and
automatically be freed from the memory. This helps with reducing memory leaks when navigating through an app.

To comply with this principle, we always use `weak` references, as they **do not increment the ARC counter**. As the
view can be deallocated, and therefore the instance isn’t available anymore (it becomes `nil`) it needs to be an
`Optional` type.

In the code example above `someViewRef` is already declared as `weak`, and so at the end of `viewDidLoad` our counter
value is 1 .

What happens if we combine the first two lines into a single one?

![A new instance assigned to a weak property will be deallocated immediately](/assets/blog//five-swift-extension-smarter-code//1_jcOha5xBrXUB8E_B2h1eXw.png)

The compiler already tells us that this statement is going to be useless. We create a new instance, but do not increment
the ARC due to `weak`. Therefore the counter is still at 0 after executing the line of code and the instance is
deallocated instantly.

Also the `someViewRef` is now optional, and we would need to unwrap the `UIView?` to add it to the parent view.

![Weak references need to be unwrapped as they are optional](/assets/blog/five-swift-extension-smarter-code/1_FOAdcefJfZWPjQasJgv9PQ.png)

To summarize our requirements:

1. we want to simplify the code into a single line
2. we need a local instance, so it doesn’t get deallocated immediately
3. we need an unwrapped instance, so we can add it to the view hierarchy
4. we need to use weak so the reference counter isn’t incremented
5. it should preferably be reusable for **_any object_**

Seems like a tough problem, doesn’t it?

Luckily, Swift provides many syntax features, so we can build our custom solution.

### Assignment function with side effects:

In the first step, move the assignment of someViewRef into a global function (can be anywhere). One parameter is the
weak inout reference, where we assign the instance to, and the the second one is the instance of the UIView .

```swift
func assign(someViewRef: inout Optional<UIView>,
            someView: UIView) -> UIView {
    someViewRef = someView
    return someView
}
```

Our viewDidLoad can be transformed to the following:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    let someView = assign(someViewRef: &someViewRef,
                            someView: UIView())
    self.view.addSubview(someView)
}
```

Great! A single line to both create the view and assign someView and someViewRef 🎉

It is still highly limited, as it only allows `UIView` instances, but we can improve this by changing the parameter to
be a generic type `T`:

```swift
func assign<T>(target: inout Optional<T>, value: T) -> T {
    target = value
    return value
}
```

You can improve it even further, by changing the value parameter to be a closure returning the value (that might become
interesting e.g. in case you want to use limited code scopes):

```swift
func assign<T>(target: inout Optional<T>, value: () -> T) -> T {
    let instance = value()
    target = instance
    return instance
}

let someView = assign(target: &someViewRef, value: {
    let view = UIView()
    view.backgroundColor = .orange
    return view
})
```

Unfortunately this breaks our previous usage:

![Values can’t be used as closure parameters (by default)](/assets/blog//five-swift-extension-smarter-code/1__g7jJ3q9BbvydAUiBGyZsA.png)

We fix it by prepending the parameter type of value with @autoclosure and both are working once again 🔥

But how do you feel about these changes?

```swift
// we started with
let someView = UIView()
someViewRef = someView

// we are now at
let someView = assign(target: &someViewRef, value: UIView())
```

Using & for the reference, and parameter names and etc. lead to a quite verbose line of code… but at least it is one
line of code, amirite?!😅

Was it worth it? Probably not… but luckily this isn’t even its final form 🤯

### The Smart Solution:

```swift
infix operator <--

public func <-- <T>(target: inout T?,
                    value: @autoclosure () -> T) -> T {
    let val = value()
    target = val
    return val
}
```

Rename the function from assign to a sleek arrow <-- and declare it as an infix operator (if you feel adventurous you
can even use an emoji arrow ⬅️). Other examples of these infix operators are + and -. All of them take two parameters...
one before, and one after the operator.

Our final solution fits all the constraints in a pretty, short syntax:

```swift
let someView = someViewRef <-- UIView()
```

## 4. Filtered element counting in Arrays

How often do you count elements in an array? What is your approach? Is it one of the following ones?

```swift
let array = ["A", "A", "B", "A", "C"]
// 1.
var count = 0
for value in array {
    if value == "A" {
        count += 1
    }
}
// 2.
count = 0
for value in array where value == "A" {
    count += 1
}
// 3.
count = array.filter { $0 == "A" }.count
// 4.
// get creative, there are many more
```

Swift tries to be as human-friendly as possible, and our code should also try to reflect the human language.

So instead of filtering, counting, iterating etc. everywhere in your codebase, checkout this clean, small, universally
applicable count(where:) extension (which honestly should exist in Swift standard library by default).

### The Smart Solution:

```swift
extension Sequence where Element: Equatable {

    func count(where isIncluded: (Element) -> Bool) -> Int {
        self.filter(isIncluded).count
    }
}
```

By extending the Sequence protocol, other classes than Array are supported too, such as ArraySlice :

```swift
["A", "A", "B"]
    .count(where: { $0 == "A" }) // 2
["B", "A", "B"]
    .dropLast(1) // --> ArraySlice<String>
    .count(where: { $0 == "B" }) // 1
```

## 5. Logic operators for SwiftUI Binding

This extension will most likely not be used as often as the others. Still it solves a struggle when working with Binding
in SwiftUI.

Take the following example, showing two buttons where each one shows a different sheet:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    @State var isPresentingSheet1 = false
    @State var isPresentingSheet2 = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Show Sheet 1") {
                isPresentingSheet1 = true
            }
            Button("Show Sheet 2") {
                isPresentingSheet2 = true
            }
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $isPresentingSheet1) {
            Text("Sheet 1")
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $isPresentingSheet2) {
            Text("Sheet 2")
        }
    }
}
```

Chaining the `.sheet(isPresented:) {...}` feels quite naturally. Unfortunately this wasn’t actually working for a long
time and got resolved only a few days ago with the
[release of iOS 14.5](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes)
(still broken in previous versions).

As I wanted to use the `isPresented` version of `.sheet()` instead of `.sheet(item:)` (with some kind of enum declaring
every single possible sheet) I tried to concatenate the two `Binding<Bool>` instances:

![Logical operators do not support Binding](/assets/blog/five-swift-extension-smarter-code/1_1p_TsE6DF8zUSxQabbxtOA.png)

Bummer. This was expected, but still I am not happy.

Fortunately we can overload the already existing infix operator && by simply creating a global function with the same
name, but with two `Binding<Bool>` parameters 🚀

### The Smart Solution:

```swift
public func && (lhs: Binding<Bool>,
                rhs: Binding<Bool>) -> Binding<Bool> {
    Binding<Bool>(get: { lhs.wrappedValue && rhs.wrappedValue },
                    set: { _ in fatalError("Not implemented") })
}
```

`Binding<Bool>` is a property wrapper which holds a `wrappedValue: Bool`. Every Binding has a getter and a setter
closure, which returns a logical conjunction of the two parameters. As the setter method is undefined (which parameter
should be changed?) we leave it with not implemented for now.

## Conclusion

There are many more smart extension out their in the wildness of the internet. All the ones listed here, are also
available, documented and tested in my toolbox [Cabinet on GitHub](https://github.com/philprime/Cabinet).
