In this section, you will learn how to assemble the Raspberry Pi hardware, set
up and configure the operating system, and establish a reliable network
connection for the cluster.

This is the second section in the series on building a production-ready
Kubernetes cluster from scratch. Make sure you have completed the
[previous section](#) before continuing here. The full list of lessons in the
series can be found
[in the overview](/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch).
