I've been working on something exciting lately - a guide about building a Kubernetes cluster from scratch using
Raspberry Pi devices! ðŸš€

## My journey with Kubernetes

A while back, I decided to build my own Kubernetes cluster at home. I wanted to learn more about how these systems work
in practice, and what better way than to build one from scratch? I chose Raspberry Pi devices because they're affordable
and perfect for learning - plus, they make for a great home lab project!

## What I've learned

Throughout this journey, I've documented everything from hardware setup to cluster configuration. The guide covers:

- Building a high-availability cluster with Raspberry Pi nodes
- Setting up the control plane and worker nodes
- Managing storage and container images
- Keeping things secure and monitored

## Who might find this useful?

I wrote this guide thinking about people like me who want to learn Kubernetes hands-on. It's particularly helpful if
you're:

- A developer curious about how Kubernetes works in practice
- Someone interested in building a home lab
- A student looking to learn about container orchestration
- Anyone who wants to understand cluster management from the ground up

## Check it out!

As always, I'm sharing this guide freely with the community. If you find it helpful, I'd appreciate your support as a
[GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/philprime) or by sharing it with others who might benefit from it.
