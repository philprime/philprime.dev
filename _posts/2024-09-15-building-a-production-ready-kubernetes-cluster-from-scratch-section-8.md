In this section, you will learn how to deploy and configure monitoring tools
like Prometheus and Grafana, set up the EFK stack (ElasticSearch, Fluentd,
Kibana) for logging, and create alerts and dashboards.

This is the eighth section in the series on building a production-ready
Kubernetes cluster from scratch. Make sure you have completed the
[previous section](#) before continuing here. The full list of lessons in the
series can be found
