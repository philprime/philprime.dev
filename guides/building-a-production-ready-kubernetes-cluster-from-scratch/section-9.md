In this section, you will learn how to deploy applications, simulate failures, test cluster resilience, and verify that
security and monitoring configurations are working correctly.

This is the ninth section in the series on building a production-ready Kubernetes cluster from scratch. Make sure you
have completed the [previous section](#) before continuing here. The full list of lessons in the series can be found
[in the overview](/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch).

## Lessons

- [L26: Deploying Sample Applications](/2024/XX/XX/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch-l26)

  > Deploy example applications to test your Kubernetes cluster’s functionality and ensure that it’s correctly
  > configured.

- [L27: Simulating Node Failures and Recovery](/2024/XX/XX/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch-l27)

  > Simulate node failures and practice recovery procedures to validate the resilience of your Kubernetes cluster.

- [L28: Verifying Security and Monitoring Configurations](/2024/XX/XX/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch-l28)

  > Verify that your security measures, monitoring tools, and configurations are working correctly to protect and
  > maintain your cluster.

## Getting Started

To get started with the section, head over to the
[twenty-sixth lesson](/building-a-production-ready-kubernetes-cluster-from-scratch/lession-11) to learn how to
initialize the first control plane node in your Kubernetes cluster.
