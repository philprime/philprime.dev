Welcome to the first lesson of our series on building a production-ready Kubernetes cluster from scratch using Raspberry
Pi devices! In this lesson, we'll provide an overview of the guide, its structure, and what you can expect to learn.
You'll see how this guide will guide you through the process of setting up a high-availability Kubernetes cluster at
home, and how the skills you gain can be applied to real-world scenarios, from personal projects to professional
environments.
