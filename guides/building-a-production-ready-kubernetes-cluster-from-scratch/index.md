Welcome to my new series on building a production-ready Kubernetes cluster from scratch using Raspberry Pi devices. In
this series, you can follow along to build your own dedicated Kubernetes cluster at home, from hardware assembly to
cluster setup and management. The learnings can then be applied to real-world scenarios, and scaled up to larger
clusters as needed.

  <p>I originally planned to offer this guide as a paid online course, but as a strong believer in free open source resources, I made it available for free instead.</p>
  <p>Please, if my guides helped you, I would be very grateful if you could support my work by becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/philprime" style="color: #000;">GitHub Sponsor</a> and by sharing the guides in your network. üôè</p>
  <p>Eventually I might offer additional guides as paid online courses, but for now, I want to focus on providing free guides.</p>
  <p>Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

In particular, this series will cover the following topics:

- Set up a high-availability Kubernetes cluster using Raspberry Pi devices, from hardware assembly to network
  configuration
- Install, configure, and manage Kubernetes control plane nodes for redundancy and fault tolerance
- Deploy persistent storage and learn to manage container images and data effectively across multiple nodes
- Implement security best practices, monitoring, and logging to maintain a resilient and secure Kubernetes cluster

This series is perfect for you, if you are any of the following:

- Tech enthusiasts, developers, and IT professionals who want to prototype cluster using Raspberry Pi devices.
- Beginner to intermediate learners with basic Linux and networking knowledge who want to deepen their understanding of
  Kubernetes.
- DIY hobbyists and makers interested in hands-on projects and building home labs or edge computing solutions with
  affordable hardware.
- DevOps engineers and system administrators looking to explore Kubernetes clustering, high availability, and storage
  management in resource-constrained environments.
- Educators and students in computer science or IT fields seeking practical experience with Kubernetes and cloud-native
  technologies.

To follow along you will need to meet these requirements:

- Basic understanding of Linux command line and shell scripting (e.g., navigating directories, editing files, running
  commands).
- Basic understanding of containerization and Docker concepts (e.g., containers, images, volumes).
- Know-how on Kubernetes concepts (pods, services, deployments) is helpful but not required.
- Familiarity with networking concepts, including IP addresses, subnets, DNS, and SSH.
- A computer running a unix-like system, such as Linux/macOS or Windows Subsystem with Linux (WSL), with access to a
  network connection.
- SSH client (e.g., OpenSSH, PuTTY) for remote access to Raspberry Pi devices.
- At least 3 Raspberry Pi devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB RAM) with MicroSD card (32GB or higher, high endurance
  recommended), USB-C power supplies for each
- NVMe HATs for each Raspberry Pi with an SSD (512GB or higher)
- A gigabit Ethernet router (e.g. TP-Link ER605) and Ethernet cables (CAT5e or higher)
