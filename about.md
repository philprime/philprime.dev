Hi, I'm Phil and I am a creator.

At some point in the past I realised how flawed some parts of our daily lives truely are. At the same point I found
myself in the space of software development.

I found my passion.

Nowadays, everything I am doing serves at least one of two purposes:

- it should improve someone's life
- it should amaze by showing unexpected possibilities
